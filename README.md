# Sudoku-Solver
This project is a Sudoku Solver implemented in C++ using a backtracking algorithm. The program takes a 9x9 Sudoku puzzle as input and provides the solution if it exists. The solver efficiently handles the constraints of the game and finds a valid solution for any solvable puzzle.

Key Features:
Utilizes backtracking to fill empty cells by trying all possibilities.
Ensures that the solution adheres to standard Sudoku rules (no duplicate numbers in rows, columns, or 3x3 grids).
Command-line interface for input and output.
Implemented and tested in Visual Studio Code.

Technologies Used:
C++ for logic implementation.
VS Code as the development environment.
Git for version control.
